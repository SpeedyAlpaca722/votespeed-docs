# Welcome to VoteSpeed

**VoteSpeed** is an all-in-one vote management plugin for Minecraft servers. It includes a built-in NuVotifier receiver, a powerful reward system, a vote shop, vote streaks, VoteParty, and much more — all in a single plugin.

## Why VoteSpeed?

Most voting setups require multiple plugins: a Votifier receiver, a vote listener, a reward plugin, a shop plugin, and more. VoteSpeed replaces all of them with a single, lightweight JAR.
